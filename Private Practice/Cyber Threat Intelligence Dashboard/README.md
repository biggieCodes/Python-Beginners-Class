A fully functional Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard with GUI Tkinter


# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard

A Python-based dashboard designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize cyber threat data in real-time or near-real-time. Built with the goal of helping individuals and organizations identify attack patterns, track threat sources, and take proactive security measures.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Aggregate cyber threat data (starting with mock data, later integrating real APIs/logs)
- Visualize threat trends and patterns (bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, etc.)
- Provide filtering by threat type, date, severity, and origin
- Generate simple insights (e.g., "Most common attack vectors this month")
- Alert users of potential threats based on custom thresholds

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tkinter` or `streamlit`
- **(Future)**: Real-world threat data from open-source APIs or logs

## 📦 Features (Planned)

| Phase | Feature | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1     | Load and display sample threat data | ✅ In Progress |
| 2     | Filtering by date, severity, type | ✅ In Progress  |
| 3     | Visual analytics (charts, graphs) | 🔜 |
| 4     | Integration with real threat data sources | ⏳ |
| 5     | Custom alerts & notifications | ⏳ |

## 🖼️ Preview (Coming Soon)

Screenshots and short demos of the dashboard will be added here once UI is live.
