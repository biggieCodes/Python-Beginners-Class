#Example of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list) #Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#Example of a nested list
my_nested_list = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5]
print(my_nested_list) #Output: [1, 2, [3, 4], 5]

#Example of an empty list       
my_empty_list = []
print(my_empty_list) #Output: []

#Example of a list with different data types
my_mixed_list = [1, "two", 3.0, True]
print(my_mixed_list) #Output: [1, "two", 3.0, True]

#Example of a list with a string
my_string_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(my_string_list) #Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Example of a list with a tuple
my_tuple_list = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
print(my_tuple_list) #Output: [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]

#Example of a list with a dictionary
my_dict_list = [{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}, {"name": "Charlie"}]
print(my_dict_list) #Output: [{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}, {"name": "Charlie"}]
