#Lists
#what is a list?
#A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
#Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed.
#Lists are defined using square brackets [].    
#Lists can contain any data type, including other lists.
#Lists can be nested, meaning a list can contain other lists.
#Lists can be empty, meaning they can contain no items.
#Lists can be indexed, meaning you can access individual items using their index.
#Lists can be sliced, meaning you can access a range of items using their index.
#Lists can be iterated, meaning you can loop through the items in a list.
#Lists can be sorted, meaning you can arrange the items in a particular order.
#Lists can be reversed, meaning you can reverse the order of the items in a list.
#Lists can be concatenated, meaning you can combine two or more lists into one.
#Lists can be repeated, meaning you can repeat the items in a list a certain number of times.
#Lists can be copied, meaning you can create a new list that is a copy of an existing list.
#Lists can be cleared, meaning you can remove all items from a list.
#Lists can be extended, meaning you can add items from one list to another.
#Lists can be inserted, meaning you can add an item at a specific index in a list.
#Lists can be removed, meaning you can remove an item from a list.
#Lists can be counted, meaning you can count the number of times an item appears in a list.
